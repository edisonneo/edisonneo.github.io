This has been my dream come true to watch Spiderman fight with Doc Ock in a movie..Waaa I can't wait..<br><br>

									So much homework, so much CCA things to do. Wa I think i really regret joining basketball..The people there are such douches and are so arrogant! Just because their in the first team it dosen't mean that they can push people around and walk like yaya papaya. Arrrghh . <br><br>
									Anyway school holidays is here and I can say that it's been a real sucky year. Secondary school sucks, I miss my real friends and I hate everyone...Hope that next year will be different..<br>

									Wa I'm really so sleepy everyday..Been nodding off in class in every lesson. Is it because I'm getting old?? I don't know what to make of being Secondary 3. It seems like with long pants comes great responsibility. Been in the basketball team for three years but I'm just a bench player and I ONLY get to play after the team is winning by like 30 points and the coach wants to rest the starters...<br>
									Chelsea is 9 points ahead in the title race. I want to believe United can catch up but...time is running out...

									Remember that big smiley face I drew a while ago??<br>
									Let's just say I can't believe how lucky I am. I was waiting for the bus to go to White Sands after school. Guess who showed up at the bus stop??? EMMA. So I stood there praying for 10 mins that we would somehow end up on the same bus. Guess what???WE BOTH BOARDED THE SAME BUSSSSSSSS!!! She smiled at me and I lost my sanity for a moment and just said "Hi, What's up?". AND SHE SAID "HI" BACK!!!!!!<br>
									Turns out she stays in Pasir Ris and I had a 30 min bus ride with her talking all the way!!. I don't even care that she likes S.H.E. and Jay Chou...We talked about Pirates of the Carribean Dead Man's Chest!!! She likes POTC!! I just can't emphasise how much I am losing my mind and smiling every day..

Can someone just tell me or assign me to a course or school so I don't have to think about it?<br><br>

									Mixed feelings.....I'm speechless....On one hand, United finally won the premier league after 4 years. The entire team was together, Rooney and Ronaldo growing into fine players, new additions Evra and Vidic completing a solid backline, Giggs playing like its 1996...<br>
									Besides that, life is pretty meaningless now...The "date" me and Emma went on..We had a great day out but at the end of the day she just told me...her family was going to move overseas in February. . . . . . . .<br>
									I asked her "So you gonna live in your auntie's house?" she said she's going as well.
									I almost broke down on the spot....I also tanked my mid-years: 46 for L1R5, life is just.........I got no future and no hopes...If I don't write here again, you'll know..
